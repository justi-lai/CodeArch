# CodeScribe: The Code Archaeology Assistant

**CodeScribe** is a VS Code extension that transforms code investigation from a time-consuming manual process into a single, seamless action. By highlighting any block of code, developers can instantly receive a rich, AI-powered narrative history that explains the "why" behind the code using advanced evolution-based git analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üî¨ **Evolution-Based Line Tracking**
- **Precision Analysis**: Uses `git blame` to track the exact evolution of selected lines across commits
- **Smart File Movement Detection**: Automatically handles file renames and moves to provide complete history
- **Targeted Diffs**: Shows only the git changes that actually affected your selected code, not generic commit diffs

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Confident Analysis**
- **Definitive Insights**: AI makes confident assertions based on commit messages, code comments, and surrounding context
- **Rich Context Awareness**: Analyzes code with 3 lines of surrounding context for better understanding
- **Google Gemini Integration**: Powered by Google's latest Gemini models for intelligent code analysis

### üìä **Interactive Timeline & GitHub Integration**
- **Chronological History**: Browse through commits that actually modified your selected lines
- **GitHub PR Context**: Seamlessly integrates PR descriptions, comments, and linked issues
- **Expandable Details**: Click to see full commit diffs, PR discussions, and historical context
- **Direct GitHub Links**: Jump to GitHub for complete context

### üé® **Polished User Experience**
- **Professional UI**: Clean, VS Code-native design optimized for sidebar viewing
- **Responsive Layout**: Efficiently uses available space with smart text wrapping and spacing
- **Secure Storage**: Uses VS Code's secure credential storage for API keys

## ÔøΩ How It Works

1. **Select Code**: Highlight any block of code in a Git repository
2. **Right-Click**: Choose "CodeScribe: Analyze Selection" from the context menu
3. **Evolution Tracking**: CodeScribe uses `git blame` to identify which commits modified those exact lines
4. **Smart Diff Extraction**: For each commit, extracts only the diff hunks that intersected with your selection
5. **AI Analysis**: Feeds commit messages, surrounding code context, and PR information to Gemini AI
6. **Confident Results**: Get definitive explanations of why the code exists and how it evolved

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies
1. **Git**: Version control system
   - Windows: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - macOS: `brew install git` or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
   - Linux: `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install git` (RHEL/CentOS)

2. **GitHub CLI**: For GitHub integration
   - Windows: `winget install GitHub.cli` or download from [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com/)
   - macOS: `brew install gh`
   - Linux: Follow [GitHub CLI installation guide](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md)

3. **GitHub Authentication**: After installing GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

4. **Google AI Studio API Key**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key (starts with "AIza...")

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace (Coming Soon)
1. Search for "CodeScribe" in VS Code Extensions
2. Click Install

### From VSIX File
1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from releases
2. Open VS Code ‚Üí Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. Run "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
4. Select the downloaded file

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. **Configure API Key**:
   - Command Palette ‚Üí "CodeScribe: Configure API Key"
   - Enter your Google AI Studio API key
   - Choose preferred model (recommended: `gemini-1.5-pro` for stability, `gemini-2.5-pro` for latest quality, or `gemini-2.5-flash` for speed)

2. **Verify Setup**: CodeScribe automatically checks dependencies on first use

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Understanding Complex Logic
```javascript
// You see this confusing function and wonder why it's so complex
function debounceWithImmediate(func, wait, immediate) {
    var timeout;
    return function executedFunction() {
        var context = this;
        var args = arguments;
        var later = function() {
            timeout = null;
            if (!immediate) func.apply(context, args);
        };
        var callNow = immediate && !timeout;
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
        if (callNow) func.apply(context, args);
    };
}
```

**CodeScribe Analysis Result:**
> **WHY THIS CODE EXISTS:**
> This debounce implementation handles both trailing and leading edge execution patterns to solve performance issues with rapid user input events. The immediate flag was added after issue #156 revealed that search autocomplete needed instant feedback on the first keystroke.

> **EVOLUTION & DECISIONS:**
> Originally implemented as simple trailing debounce, but PR #234 added immediate execution support when users complained about delayed search results. The complex timeout logic ensures both patterns work correctly without interference.

### Investigating Performance Optimizations
```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def expensive_calculation(x, y, matrix_size=1000):
    # Why is this cached? What's the performance impact?
    return heavy_matrix_operation(x, y, matrix_size)
```

**CodeScribe Analysis:**
> **WHY THIS CODE EXISTS:**
> This caching decorator was added to solve a critical performance bottleneck where the same calculations were being repeated hundreds of times per user session. Profiling data in PR #89 showed this function consumed 40% of CPU time before optimization.

## üé® What Makes CodeScribe Different

### Traditional Approach ‚ùå
- Manually dig through `git log` and `git blame`
- Search for related PRs and issues
- Piece together context from multiple sources
- Guess at the reasoning behind changes
- Spend 15-30 minutes per investigation

### CodeScribe Approach ‚úÖ
- Select code ‚Üí right-click ‚Üí instant analysis
- Evolution-based tracking finds exact relevant commits
- AI confidently explains purpose based on rich context
- Complete timeline with GitHub integration
- Get definitive answers in seconds

## üîß Advanced Features

### Evolution-Based Tracking
Unlike tools that rely on text matching, CodeScribe uses git's internal line tracking to:
- Handle file renames and moves seamlessly
- Track lines through refactoring and reformatting
- Find relevant changes even when code has been heavily modified

### Smart Context Analysis
The AI analyzes:
- **Selected code** and surrounding lines for context
- **Commit messages** explaining the intent behind changes
- **PR descriptions** detailing problems and solutions
- **Code comments** providing developer insights
- **Related issues** linked to PRs for full background

### Intelligent Diff Filtering
Instead of showing entire commit diffs, CodeScribe:
- Extracts only hunks that intersected with your selected lines
- Uses mathematical line range analysis for precision
- Handles complex git history with multiple file paths
- Provides focused, relevant change information
