## üéØ Usage Examples

### Understanding Complex Trading Logic
```python
def calculate_portfolio_var(positions, correlation_matrix, confidence_level=0.95):
    # Complex VaR calculation - why this specific approach?
    portfolio_variance = np.dot(positions.T, np.dot(correlation_matrix, positions))
    portfolio_std = np.sqrt(portfolio_variance)
    z_score = norm.ppf(confidence_level)
    return portfolio_std * z_score
```

**CodeScribe Analysis Result (Finance Mode):**
> **WHY THIS CODE EXISTS:**
> This Value-at-Risk implementation uses the parametric approach to meet regulatory risk reporting requirements. The correlation matrix method was chosen over Monte Carlo simulation for daily risk calculations due to performance requirements specified in issue #89.

> **FINANCIAL CONTEXT:**
> This VaR calculation follows Basel III guidelines for market risk assessment. The 95% confidence level is mandated by internal risk policies, and the correlation matrix approach ensures sub-second calculation times for the real-time risk dashboard.

### Investigating Performance Optimizations
```javascript
// You see this confusing function and wonder why it's so complex
function debounceWithImmediate(func, wait, immediate) {
    var timeout;
    return function executedFunction() {
        var context = this;
        var args = arguments;
        var later = function() {
            timeout = null;
            if (!immediate) func.apply(context, args);
        };
        var callNow = immediate && !timeout;
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
        if (callNow) func.apply(context, args);
    };
}
```

**CodeScribe Analysis Result (Code Mode):**
> **WHY THIS CODE EXISTS:**
> This debounce implementation handles both trailing and leading edge execution patterns to solve performance issues with rapid user input events. The immediate flag was added after issue #156 revealed that search autocomplete needed instant feedback on the first keystroke.

> **EVOLUTION & DECISIONS:**
> Originally implemented as simple trailing debounce, but PR #234 added immediate execution support when users complained about delayed search results. The complex timeout logic ensures both patterns work correctly without interference.

### Financial Chat Interface Example
```
User: "How can I optimize this backtesting strategy?"
[Code context automatically added from current selection]

CodeScribe (Finance Mode): "Based on your Zipline strategy code, I can see several optimization opportunities:

1. **Vectorization**: Your current position sizing logic uses loops. Consider using pandas vectorized operations for the moving average calculations.

2. **Commission Model**: You're using the default commission model. For more accurate backtesting, implement a tiered commission structure based on your actual broker fees.

3. **Slippage Modeling**: Consider adding realistic slippage models, especially for the momentum-based entries you're using.

Would you like me to show specific code improvements for any of these areas?"
```
